TODO

- Rewrite index.php using new question callbacks
- Inline editing of IP ban
- Convert antispam/IP ban to own tables - inline editing
- Sort out jQuery mess
- Convert prototype to jQuery where possible
- Further static method usage where possible
- Javadoc bits
- Fix user-defined timeout
- Sort out layout - date doesn't need to be so prominent
- User-defined timezone offset
- Remove admin permalinks, or attach them to the date (with date move) - currently useless
- Category sorting - not really necessary where it is, possibly list them on the side instead for sorting
- Related to above - move category to same place as IP? (With date?)
- Change (e) to an icon or something
- Inline Q/A editing needs to be more obvious - icon?
- Rename back to PAI?
- Settings layout needs sorting - password at the top
- Pagination - 1 2 ... 10 >> please. Also on bottom.
- Nicer forms
- Better layout in general
- HTML5 please!
- mod_rewrite?
- Remove debug
- TEST!
